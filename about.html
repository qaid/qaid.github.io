                <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
                <p class="lead">
                    I'm a designer and thinker cut from a different cloth. I've done creative and strategic 
                    work in 5 different industries over the past 15 years. Catch me in the DJ booth if I'm 
                    not on the basketball court.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My approach to design is rooted in curiosity and attention to detail. I believe that 
                    great design happens at the intersection of user needs, business goals, and technical 
                    possibilities. Every project is an opportunity to solve meaningful problems and create 
                    experiences that matter.

                <h3>Music & DJing</h3>
                <p>
                    When I'm not designing, you'll find me behind the turntables. Music has always been 
                    a creative outlet and source of inspiration for my design work. The rhythm and flow 
                    of a good mix translates directly to creating seamless user experiences.

                <p>
                    Basketball teaches strategy, teamwork, and quick decision-making - skills that 
                    translate perfectly to design work. Whether it's reading the court or reading 
                    user behavior, it's all about anticipating the next move.

                    I'm constantly exploring new design tools, methodologies, and industry trends. 
                    From attending conferences to experimenting with emerging technologies, I believe 
                    in staying curious and pushing creative boundaries.
